This program makes use of **vectors** in order to
form an array of semesters which </br> in turn also stores an array of courses for that semester.
 </br>
 You can add as many semesters as you want and the program will calculate your **GPA**.</br>
 </br>
 You may also save the existing list of semesters to a CSV file.</br>
 You can later load from your save files and avoid starting from scratch.
