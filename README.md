This program makes use of **vectors** in order to
form an array of semesters which </br> in turn also stores an array of courses for that semester.
 </br>
 You can add as many semesters as you want and the program will calculate your **GPA**.</br>
 </br>
 You may also save the existing list of semesters to a CSV file.</br>
 You can later load from your save files and avoid starting from scratch.

An example of execution:
</br>
</br>
<img src="./Pictures/SampleExecution.png" width="386" height="500">
</br>
</br>
If we had a save file such as:


</br>
<img src="./Pictures/testFile.png" width="135" height="157.5">
</br>
</br>
Then we could load it and we would get:
</br>
</br>
<img src="./Pictures/testCL.png" width="380" height="440">
